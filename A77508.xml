            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then indeed (≈øay they) was this <hi>order</hi> introduced as a middle office betwixt Bi≈øhops and Deacons. But before that, there were no other ordinary offices in the Church, but the≈øe two, taking the word <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> in a ≈øtrict acception; and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Presbytery</hi> here ≈øpoken of could bee no other.

Neither indeed is there any rea≈øon they ≈øhould, in as much as it runnes ≈øo directly cro≈ø≈øe; as to clear evidence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ≈øo to the general (if not univer≈øal) con≈øent of all divines both Ancient and Modern; who look upon the office of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> precedent to that of a <hi>Bi≈øhop.</hi> Yea ≈øo nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarily preceding it, that who ever ≈øhall be ordained a <hi>Bi≈øhop, per ≈øaltum,</hi> not having fir≈øt a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> they pronounce his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination invalid, a meer nullity. So it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed both by <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> &amp; <hi>Papi≈øts.</hi> Yea by the moderate on both the≈øe parts it is al≈øo yeilded, that <hi>Presbyiery is the highe≈øt order of ordinary Go≈øpel mini≈øtery.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170143:12"/>and ≈øo in like manner upon the two <hi>Rams</hi> ver≈ø. 15.19. thereby dedicating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecrating of them unto God. 3 In <hi>Atte≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in giving evidence again≈øt a Capital offender, of this you read <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.14. where the Law for puni≈øhing the <hi>Bla≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> requires, that his accu≈øers ≈øhould lay their hands upon his head, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Te≈øtimony. 4. In <hi>Re≈øigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Thus wee finde the <hi>Children of I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> (≈øome chief among them in the name of the re≈øt) laying their hands upon the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> (which they did) not to <hi>ordain</hi> them to their office, no, that was done by <hi>Aaron,</hi> by whom they were <hi>offered up unto the Lord,</hi> (as the next ver≈øe hath it) but that thereby they might declare and te≈øtify both their <hi>Re≈øignation</hi> and <hi>Approbation</hi> of them, how that they did for their parts, give up all the carnal and worldly intere≈øts which they had in them, and did approve of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which was then to bee conferred upon them. 5 In <hi>De≈øignation,</hi> in de≈øigning and appointing one to an office.

Secondly, In <hi>Miraculous operations,</hi> in healing of bodily di≈øea≈øes. Thus our Saviour is ≈øaid to have wrought that cure upon that infirm woman <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.13. by <hi>laying his hands upon her.</hi> and the like power he gave to his Apo≈øtles, after his departure, as al≈øo to ≈øome others in tho≈øe primitive times. <hi>They ≈øhall lay their hands on the ≈øick, and they ≈øhall recover,</hi> Mark. 16.18.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170143:17"/>touching the bu≈øine≈øs which wee are here met about this day, the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. So I call it (let that bee the fir≈øt of them) and that not without good warrant from my Text, <hi>the Ordinance of Ordination.</hi> And that not a <hi>humane,</hi> but a <hi>divine</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ≈øo of perpetual u≈øe unto the Church of God; which were it but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ≈øurely it would not bee ≈øo ≈øleighted, as by many it is at this day. <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> here is, that hee ≈øhould not <hi>neglect the Gift</hi> which hee had received in, and by his Ordination. How is it that ≈øo many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ≈øo ≈øleight this <hi>gift,</hi> as that they will not receive it in this way? No, if they have but a <hi>Call</hi> (as they call it) an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> by two or three, and can by any means procure a formal <hi>Approbation,</hi> or yet a <hi>Toleration;</hi> it is enough for them. A <hi>Gift</hi> they have already (at lea≈øt as they think) and they look out for no more. Now they let upon the work, and that not as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationers,</hi> for tryal ≈øake, in order to <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which being done with the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of tho≈øe who have power to lay on hands, and that for ≈øome competent time, untill Ordination can bee obtained, I have nothing to ≈øay again≈øt it) but in a <hi>fixed way,</hi> as their ≈øetled imployment.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170143:17"/>Ordination; <hi>Teach</hi> they may, but <hi>preach</hi> they cannot. <hi>How ≈øhall they preach except they bee ≈øent?</hi> Rom. 10.15.

So nece≈ø≈øary is <hi>Ordination</hi> (I mean, for the ≈øub≈øtance of it) as that (in an ordinary way) none can perform any mini≈øterial act without it. But I mu≈øt but touch upon things, only giving you a hint of what might have been inlarged.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>As for the more moderate ≈øpirits among our ≈øelves, (with whom I de≈øire onely to deal, and for who≈øe ≈øakes it is that I ≈øpeak what I do) how ever they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as the more regular way, more agreeable to the practice of Antiquity, and the Scripture pattern, yet they freely yeild it, that where this is not to bee had, where either there are no ≈øuch <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> or tho≈øe not fit, or not willing to ordain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but of their own faction, them≈øelves being not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> or el≈øe (which is all one) not permitted to exerci≈øe that part, of their ≈øuppo≈øed Juri≈ødiction, now the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> ordinary Presbyters, may do it without them.

            <p>And La≈øtly, On the contrary, the <hi>great reward</hi> which remains for every faithful Mini≈øter, for every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcientiou≈øly and in ≈øome good mea≈øure di≈øchargeth it as he ought.</p>
            <p>And in in≈øtructing you herein, I de≈øire to in≈øtruct my ≈øelf, as being one of the ≈øame function with you.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For the <hi>burthen and weightine≈ø≈øe of the Calling:</hi> when I con≈øider how <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> Prophets all, ≈øufficiently and abundantly gifted, did ≈øo earne≈øtly decline it: and when I finde the great Apo≈øtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> accounting him≈øelf as <hi>in≈øufficient</hi> for the work of the Minitery: and not only the mo≈øt fu≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of the Apo≈øtles, but the mo≈øt able al≈øo of all the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> (great St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi>) ≈øhedding tears at the time of his Ordination, how can I, or any of you, but tremble at the burthen of it?</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> how unwilling hee was to undertake ≈øo great a burthen, doth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170143:28"/>many ways appear in Scripture, and that very remarkably: for when God called him to the office of a Prophet, and made choice of him to go unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> wee ≈øhall finde him ≈øtrangely drawing back the ≈øhoulder more then once or twice.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, At the very beginning, when God fir≈øt ≈øpake unto him of it, Exo. 3.11. <hi>Come now therefore, and I will ≈øend thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Pharaoh, &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>≈øaid unto God, who am I, that I ≈øhould go unto</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh? <hi>who am I,</hi> there is the fir≈øt expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his unwillingne≈ø≈øe unto it.</p>
            <p>Then again, after God had told him, that hee would certainly bee with him in the work, yet hee hath another excu≈øe for his backwardne≈øs; in the fir≈øt ver≈ø. of the next Chapter, Exod. 4.1. <hi>But behold they will not beleeve mee, for they will ≈øay, the Lord hath not appeared to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after God had provided again≈øt this excu≈øe al≈øo by three miraculous ≈øigns, which hee enabled him to perform, yet ≈øtill he draws back, and makes a new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe, hee pretends now that hee wants eloquence, ver≈ø. 10. <hi>O my Lord, I am not Eloquent, neither heretofore, nor ≈øince thou ha≈øt ≈øpoken unto thy ≈øervant: but I am ≈ølow of ≈øpeech, and of a ≈ølow tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea further, after God had ≈øtopt his mouth here al≈øo, telling him that he would be with his mouth, <hi>and teach him what he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170143:29"/>≈øhould ≈øay,</hi> yet for all this, when hee ≈øaw none of his excu≈øes would hold, hee then in plain terms lays down his Commi≈ø≈øion, and de≈øires God to ≈øend another in his ≈øtead, ver≈ø. 13. <hi>And hee ≈øaid, O my Lord, ≈øend I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt ≈øend,</hi> that is, by ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more fit than my ≈øelf, (as Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters expound it) ≈øo <hi>Calvin, Rivet,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Neither could God get him to go, till his anger was kindled again≈øt him, nor till hee provided a <hi>≈øecond</hi> to go along with him, till hee told him his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aaron</hi> ≈øhould go as an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant with him in the work, as it is in the next ver≈ø</p>
            <p>And that which aggravates all the re≈øt, is, that even before God called him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, there was no man fitter for ≈øo great a work, either in regard of all <hi>outward accompli≈øhments of body, or abilities of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>outward bodily endowments,</hi> hee was <hi>a goodly child,</hi> as ≈øoon as ever hee was born <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.2. which though it bee but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcurely there expre≈ø≈øed in the Hebrew Original, yet the Apo≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ≈øufficiently explains it, when he ≈øtiles him, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Neither was it ≈øo in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> alone, but in the next place in that other great <hi>Prophet,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ye may ≈øee a great backwardne≈ø≈øe al≈øo to enter upon this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.6. for after God had called him unto it in the ver≈øe before, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently crys out: <hi>Ah, Lord God!

            </p>
            <p>And yet God did not call him from the <hi>Plow,</hi> as hee did the Prophet <hi>Eli≈øha,</hi> nor from the <hi>Herdmen,</hi> as hee did the Prophet <hi>Amos:</hi> Nor from the fi≈øher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as hee did his <hi>Apo≈øtles, Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> for how much more then would hee have uttered ≈øuch words? but God calls him from among the <hi>Prie≈øts,</hi> from the Prie≈øts that were in <hi>Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</hi> ver≈ø. 1. where no doubt he had the education of a Scholler.</p>
            <p>And in the third place, as great a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈øs was to be found in the Prophet <hi>Jonah:</hi> for though it was not upon his fir≈øt call to bee a Prophet, as the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were; yet upon his fir≈øt call to bee a Prophet to the Heatheni≈øh <hi>Ninevites,</hi> hee ≈øhewed as ≈øtrange an aver≈øne≈øs as either of the former, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1.3. for it was not onely a bare <hi>unwillingne≈ø≈øe</hi> that appeared in him, nor onely a peremptory <hi>refu≈øal</hi> of it, but a direct <hi>flying</hi> from the pre≈øence of God upon it, a quite for≈øaking of the land of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and going unto <hi>Tar≈øhi≈øh</hi> a ≈øtrange Country.</p>
            <p>Neither could God get him to go on his me≈ø≈øage to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> till hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a ≈øecond call unto it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.1. and yee know how hee was fain to bee prepared too to the entertainment of that

               <hi>St. Augu≈øtine</hi> put it for one of his three great wi≈øhes, that hee might but once have <hi>heard him preach out of a pulpit:</hi> and was hee not the great Doctor of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> de≈øtined peculiarly unto them above all the re≈øt of the Apo≈øtles?

            <p>And I would wi≈øh all young Schollers and Students in Divinity, next unto the two Epi≈øtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that to <hi>Titus,</hi> to read over this Epi≈øtle of St. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> to <hi>Valerius:</hi> Where they ≈øhall finde how difficult a task the Mini≈øterial function is, and how unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that great <hi>Light of the Church</hi> was to undertake it.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides all the≈øe choice and pregnant in≈øtances, it will many other ways ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what a <hi>weighty Calling</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery is, and how great the burden of it.</p>
            <p>True it is, that there are many <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble titles</hi> given to the Mini≈øters of God in Scripture: as that they are <hi>Men of God, Gods Emba≈ø≈øadours, Gods Stewards:</hi> that they are <hi>Rulers, Elders, ≈øpiritual Fathers</hi> the <hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi> the <hi>Starres</hi> of the Churches, and the like: but all the≈øe do as well include their Duty as their <hi>dignity,</hi> and are as much for the <hi>Onus</hi> of the Mini≈øtery, as the <hi>Honos</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Is it not a weighty Calling that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ≈øo much <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi>

            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:170143:34"/>
            <p> And herein the crafty Je≈øuits have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to play the Apes of the Prote≈øtant writers, as in ≈øtudying the tongues, and many other things, ≈øo in this of <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:</hi> they knowing full well the great nece≈ø≈øity of it; and ≈øo may wee among our ≈øelves by the ignorant back≈øliding of ≈øo many from the truth in the≈øe days.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>re≈øolving ca≈øes of con≈øcience,</hi> as it is a very nece≈ø≈øary duty of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, ≈øo it needs a very skilful and able Divine: and though he Popi≈øh writers have herein got the ≈øtart of our Prote≈øtant Divines, they having been always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the greate≈øt <hi>Ca≈øui≈øts,</hi> although with abundance of dro≈øs in them; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øince that godly-learned man, Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> did ≈øet <hi>Ca≈øe-Divinity</hi> on foot, by re≈øolving ≈øo many ca≈øes of Con≈øcience, in his long continued preaching on that ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, many eminent Divines have ≈øince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them≈øelves unto it: as Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> upon the Decalogue; and divers other in the≈øe dayes; Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> confe≈ø≈øing that his hearing Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> preach thereupon when hee was a youth, made him ever after in love with that part of Divinity, in his preface to his Ca≈øes of Con≈øcience.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo for the <hi>binding up of broken hearts,</hi> as it is a mo≈øt ≈øoveraign part of the mini≈øterial office, ≈øo it requires a mo≈øt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170143:35"/>knowing and experimental Divine for to do it: a great deal of wi≈ødome al≈øo and di≈øcretion mu≈øt bee u≈øed towards ≈øuch, and they are very tenderly to bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

            <p>And for the careful in≈øpection over the whole flock, the Mini≈øter as hee hath <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram animarum,</hi> ≈øo hee hath <hi>curam uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øcuju≈øque animae,</hi> hee hath the charge of every ≈øoul in his pari≈øh, and mu≈øt give an account for every one that belongs to his charge: according to that of the Apo≈øtle; Heb. 13.17. <hi>They watch for your Souls, as they that mu≈øt give account,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>One thing more there is, which I count none of the ≈ømalle≈øt part of the Mini≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial burthen, e≈øpecially in the≈øe times of ours: and that is, the <hi>Admini≈øtration of the Sacraments;</hi> for though I bee no patron of <hi>mixt communions</hi> (as they call them) or a promi≈øcuous reception of all ≈øorts, unto the holy Sacrament of the Lords ≈øupper, whether they bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ≈øcandalous: yet ≈øeeing every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter, as hee is called a <hi>Mini≈øter of the Word and Sacraments,</hi> ≈øo it is his duty to do both: mee thinks all the wi≈ødome and di≈øcretion that can be, ≈øhould be u≈øed by him, rather than wholly to fail of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting this main branch of his office; Doubtle≈ø≈øe he ought as to be very con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiou≈øly

            <p>And ≈øo much the rather, becau≈øe it hath been alwayes the devils main po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to ca≈øt in a bone of contention into the Church of God, about this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Sacrament;</hi> as appeared fir≈øt by the <hi>Papi≈øts Tran≈øub≈øtantiation,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the <hi>Lutherans Con≈øub≈øtantiation,</hi> and now in our days, by this ≈øo much controverted point of <hi>mixt Communions:</hi> by all which the Church hath been ≈øo rent and divided; as by nothing more; as <hi>Lavater</hi> in that excellent peece of his, <hi>Hi≈øtoria Saeramentaria</hi> hath evidently ≈øhown, that old wily Serpent, making that to bee the greate≈øt cau≈øe of divi≈øion among Chri≈øtians, which ought to be the greate≈øt cau≈øe of union among them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks, 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it requires ≈øo much skill, and ≈øo much prudence to manage well the function of the Mini≈øtery: ≈øo in the next place is it not a work of much labour too, and great pains? ≈øurely it mu≈øt be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laborious work, when in Scripture the Mini≈øters of God are compared to <hi>Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandem,</hi> to <hi>builders,</hi> to <hi>harve≈øt-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> to <hi>Shepheards,</hi> to <hi>Watchmen,</hi> to <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> to <hi>Nur≈øes,</hi> and the like.

            <p>But that which is the main of all, ≈øuch Mini≈øters endanger theirown fouls, and runne the hazzard of lo≈øing everla≈øting ≈øalvation: and what a pittiful thing it is that any of us who≈øe office it is to convert mens ≈øouls, and to ≈øave the ≈øouls of others, ≈øhould fall ≈øhort of ≈øaving our own ≈øouls; that <hi>Judas</hi> who had once a place among the number of the twelve Apo≈øtles, mu≈øt yet at length go to his own place in hell, as it is, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.25. <hi>From which</hi> Judas <hi>by tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion fell, that he might go to his own place.</hi>

            <p>And yet this is not all, for ≈øuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters do not only endanger their own ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but they ≈øhall have an heavier pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of damnation than others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>Surely an evil and unfaithful Mini≈øter is one of the greate≈øt partakers of other mens ≈øinnes, of any rank of men, and hath herein the greater account to give unto God: ≈øo that not without great cau≈øe did that good man pray, <hi>Lord forgive mee my other mens ≈øins.</hi>

            <p>But when men will make u≈øe of this &amp; other of their gifts, onely for their own credit ≈øake, and to cry up them≈øelves in the Pulpit, without making the glory of God

            <p>St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that devout and learned Father, hath a very pious pa≈ø≈øage to this purpo≈øe, in an Epi≈øtle of his to <hi>Nepotian, Docente te in Eccle≈øia, non clamor populi, ≈øed gemitus ≈øu≈øcitetur: lacrymae auditorum, laudes tuae ≈øint; Let the many weeping eyes, the ≈øighs and groans of thy auditours, be thy commendation when thou preache≈øt</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>and not the vain applau≈øe of men,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is that which will commend thee with God, and with all good men.</p>
            <p>Thus having briefly removed the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, let mee now more briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto you the helps and furtheran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ≈øo an end.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Bee much in prayer,</hi> as that which will much help forward the fulfilling of your Mini≈øtry: for if Prayer be the Chri≈øtians daily exerci≈øe, then how much more ≈øhould it bee the <hi>Mini≈øters daily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exerci≈øe?</hi> And if any thing may bee obtained by Prayer, then how much need hath a Mini≈øter of God to bee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at it, who hath ≈øo many things to pray for, in behalf of ≈øo weighty a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? and if our <hi>Saviour</hi> him≈øelf ≈øpent a whole night in prayer unto God, when
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170143:48"/>hee was to choo≈øe his twelve Apo≈øtles, ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them apart for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12, 13. then how much farre greater rea≈øon, hath every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter among us, to bee much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto him for him≈øelf, that he may bee able to go well thorough with ≈øo hard a task.</p>
            <p>The practice of great <hi>Luther</hi> is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for this, and very exemplary for all of us Mini≈øters: who though he was a man of the mo≈øt <hi>Heroical and undaunted ≈øpirit</hi> that we read of, yet he made a great deal of more u≈øe of <hi>his vehement ≈øpirit of Prayer,</hi> whereby to ≈øet upon the work: for ≈øo wee find it recorded of him, that he did <hi>Tres ad minimum horas, easque ≈øtudiis apti≈ø≈øimas in orationem ponere;</hi> ≈øpend no le≈ø≈øe than three hours daily by him≈øelf in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and tho≈øe which were the fitte≈øt hours for his ≈øtudy too; And I beleeve that he lo≈øt no time in ≈øo doing, towards his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øterial employments.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Bee diligent in ≈øtudy and meditation,</hi> that yee may this way al≈øo bee the better furni≈øhed and prepared for ≈øo weighty a function: for as all our ≈øtudying will do little good, except wee further it by our frequent praying, ≈øo all ur praying will not bee ≈øufficient except wee join in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtrious <hi>≈øtudy</hi> and <hi>meditation</hi> with it, both which together are the means appointed by God.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:170143:49"/>
            <p> And therefore is is an injunction given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy: Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrin,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. as well to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to preaching: and ≈øo much more to reading, becau≈øe ≈øo much the better to preaching; and in the next ver≈øe but one, <hi>Meditate upon the≈øe things, give thy ≈øelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi> Whence <hi>Luther</hi> again added this ≈øecond help to the former, in another ≈øententious ≈øaying, which hee was wont to utter: <hi>Tria faciunt Theologium, Oratio, Meditatio, Tentatio:</hi> the≈øe three things make an accompli≈øht Divine, Prayer, Meditation, and Temptation; for as for the latter of the three, him≈øelf was ≈øo much exerci≈øed with the Devils Temptations, that hee thought him the mo≈øt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Divine that was mo≈øt troubled with them: and indeed next unto Chri≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, I have not read of one more a≈ø≈øaulted with them, than this greate≈øt <hi>Engine</hi> of the Churches reformation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Labour to Preach out of love to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ≈øouls,</hi> Which <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath redeemed at ≈øo high a price: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates to the Elders of <hi>Ephe≈øus,</hi> when he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to <hi>feed the Church of God, which hee hath purcha≈øed with his own bloud,</hi> Act. 20.28.</p>
            <p>For ≈øeeing, <hi>what ≈øhall it profit a man if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170143:49"/>hee gain the whole world, and lo≈øe his own Soul,</hi> as our Saviour ≈øayes? how ≈øhould wee Mini≈øters bee moved with bowels of Compa≈ø≈øion unto the ≈øouls of men, to draw as many of them as po≈ø≈øible wee can out of the Devils kingdome, it being our office to <hi>≈øave Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which end, mee thinks there is ≈øuch a remarkable ≈øaying of the great Apo≈øtle concerning him≈øelf, that I know not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all his Epi≈øtles which hath more wrought upon mee as a Mini≈øter, or may more move any Con≈øcientious Mini≈øter, if ≈øeriou≈øly thought upon: it is, 2 Cor. 12.15. <hi>I will very gladly ≈øpend and be ≈øpent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the le≈ø≈øe I bee loved.</hi> Here was love indeed to the ≈øouls of his people.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And La≈øtly, <hi>Labour to preach out of love to the Lord Je≈øus,</hi> the <hi>great Shepheard of the ≈øheep;</hi> and who≈øe they are, <hi>John</hi> 10.14. which if wee do, it will make us the better do the former duty; for our love to <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> will force us to bear love to mens ≈øouls, which hee hath ≈øo dearly bought. And if once the love of Chri≈øt come to con≈øtrain us, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, then wee ≈øhall play the zealous and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mini≈øters to purpo≈øe: it is only this that can make us become martyrs if need bee, and <hi>to lay down our lives for the Sheep,</hi> and for the <hi>cheif Shepheard too:</hi> ask old <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:170143:50"/>el≈øe, that mo≈øt Antient Father, when a little before his glorious martyrdome he uttered the≈øe mo≈øt affectionate words, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor meus crucifixus e≈øt; my Love was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore was it, that no le≈ø≈øe than three ≈øeveral times together, <hi>Christ</hi> ≈øaid unto St. <hi>Peter: Simon ≈øon of Jonas; love≈øt thou mee? feed my Sheep,</hi> John 21.17. which I could wi≈øh both you, and I, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hear ≈øounding in our ears, as a mo≈øt ≈øoveraign motive to fulfil our mini≈øtry to the utmo≈øt of our indeavours: <hi>Love≈øt thou mee? feed my Sheep.</hi> And which as it was in a manner the conclu≈øion of our Saviours words, a little before his A≈øcen≈øion into heaven: ≈øo it ≈øhall be the conclu≈øion of my Exhortation unto you.</p>
